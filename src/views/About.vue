    Started after completing bootcamp myself, learning the three basics and then
    React, Angular, asp.Net, Vue, Python and also Node.js. From there I went on
    to offering courses through Udemy, FrameworkTV, FullSail University and then
    building websites as a freelancer for clients. I currently service 33 sites,
    built 248 apps, sold over 100 templates, and sintructed over 70 students
    with Wyzant and recently got on Udemy.

    My goal and objective is to teach anyone who wants to learn a language at an
    affordable price, while getting them proficient in the languages being
    taught. For more information on teaching groups, individuals or hiring a
